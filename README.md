# Ray Noises App

A simple soundboard application created as a joke but also for me to learn using React Context to handle multilingual user interfaces.

## Getting Started

The primary way to use this web application is with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), however it is possible to run the script standalone with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Prerequisites

One of the following can be used but Docker is recommended. Follow the instructions in the Docker documentation to install Docker on the system of your choice.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node.js (optional)](https://nodejs.org/): If not using Docker, just run with npm start.
